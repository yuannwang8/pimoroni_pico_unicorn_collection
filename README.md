# Pimoroni Pico Unicorn Collection
This is a collection of scripts for the [Pimoroni Pico Unicorn](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-unicorn-pack) pack. Remember to use Pimoroni's [custom MicroPython uf2](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases) and specifically the [pico unicorn](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/libraries/pico_unicorn) library.

## Items

1. Conway's Game of Life based on [Steve Baine's post for Pico Unicorn pack on the Pimoroni forum](https://forums.pimoroni.com/t/pico-unicorn-pack-not-working-in-micropython/15997). Button B reseeds the game while button X exits the game altogether.
